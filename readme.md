Here We GO

I also started a code review through a hackerrank.
This will be a huge help on my way to becoming an aspiring software developer. 
I am grateful to the senior programmers who have supported me. 

Their experience and the knowledge they give is invaluable to me. 
Being a full-time engineer is a much harder job, and because of my hard work, I continue this path even by writing a book. 

I want future engineers to draw conclusions about how wrong or right the road I am walking. 

Along the way, I will continue to work on myself every day, moving forward towards my goal.
